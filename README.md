## **Python CI/CD Example with GitHub Codespaces**

This is a simple Python project to demonstrate how to set up **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)** using **GitHub Actions** and **GitHub Codespaces**. The project includes a basic Python script and unit tests to verify its functionality. 

The CI/CD pipeline automatically tests the code and ensures quality on every push or pull request to the `main` branch.

### **How to Set Up the Project**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

#### **1. Clone the Repository**
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/python-cicd-example.git
   cd python-cicd-example
   ```

#### **2. Install Python**
Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed on your system. Check the version with:
```bash
python --version
```

#### **3. Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended)
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

#### **4. Install Dependencies**
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **5. Run the Project**
1. Execute the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   You should see the output:
   ```
   Hello, GitHub Codespaces!
   ```

2. Run the unit tests:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover
   ```
   The tests should pass successfully.

### **How to Enable CI/CD**

1. Commit and push changes to the repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial project setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
3. You will see the CI/CD workflow running automatically. It tests the code and ensures all checks pass.

---

### **How to Use GitHub Codespaces**

1. Open the repository in GitHub.
2. Click on the **Code** button and select **Open with Codespaces**.
3. GitHub Codespaces will launch a development container with the pre-configured environment.
4. Run the project or tests directly in Codespaces:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   python -m unittest discover
   ```

### **FAQ**
1. **What if I encounter errors while running the tests?**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed and Python 3.10 or later is used.
   - Verify that `requirements.txt` does not include built-in libraries like `unittest`.

2. **Can I use a Python version other than 3.10?**
   - Yes, but ensure compatibility with your environment and update the `ci-cd.yml` file to match the Python version.
